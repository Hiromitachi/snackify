# GitHub Setup Instructions

## Step 1: Create GitHub Repository

1. Go to: https://github.com/new
2. Repository name: **snackify**
3. Description: "A modern snack review and rating app 🍿"
4. Choose **Public** or **Private**
5. **Important:** Do NOT check "Initialize with README" (we already have one)
6. Click "Create repository"

## Step 2: After Creating Repository

Once you've created the repository on GitHub, I'll run:

```bash
git push -u origin main
```

This will upload all your Snackify code to GitHub!

## Step 3: Deploy to Vercel (Optional)

After pushing to GitHub, we can deploy your app for free:

1. Go to: https://vercel.com/signup
2. Sign up with GitHub
3. Import your `snackify` repository
4. Click "Deploy"
5. Your app will be live at: `snackify.vercel.app` (or similar)
